My personal website: https://www.rdegges.com


## Dependencies

This site is built using [Hugo][], the Golang based static site generator.  It
is really awesome.

You need to have Hugo installed before working with this site.


## Theme

I've built my own custom theme here for my personal usage -- feel free to take
from it what you want.  I release it into the public domain.


## Writing

My blog posts are stored in a separate repository.  I do this to keep my writing
organized and structured.


## Building

To build the site, simply run `hugo` in the project directory.

To build the site for local development purposes, run `hugo server --watch` --
then open http://localhost:1313 to view the site.
